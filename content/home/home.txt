Too often, artists are forced to compromise their work due to the limitations of their studio. We founded Unnamed to solve this problem. Unnamed believes that space and equipment should adapt to the needs of artists, not the other way around.

Unnamed is a network of studio facilities for professional artists working in multiple disciplines. We work to accommodate projects of all kind. Drop us a line if you are looking for a homebase for your practice or need space to pursue a special project â€“ we are here to help make ideas happen!
